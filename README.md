2. **Dataset**:
   
   - [Link drive to download Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_3JckYWL6bLGh8cu_JtG2LzMEAdoCGat?usp=sharing)
   
    Composed of 5 different subjects performing a total of 8 trials using a motion capture system with 8 cameras in a closed environment with standard lighting. The dataset simulates various types of human movements, capturing different distances, orientations, heights, and poses. Each trial lasts approximately 2 minutes with a single person in the room.
    The various scenes were also recorded simultaneously with a RealSense camera, positioned statically at a height of 1.25 meters to obtain the same view as when Pepper is in an upright position.

The analyzed scenes include:
- Standard walk back and forth
- Walk back and forth with arms crossed
- Walk back and forth with sudden movements (e.g., dodging an obstacle)
- Walk back and forth in a zigzag pattern with pronounced head movements
